- The Bot does not analyze, sell, or share any data with third parties.  

---

## 3. User Responsibility
- Users must ensure they have the **right to use the Bot** on any server they attempt to clone.  
- Misuse of the Bot (e.g., cloning servers without authorization) may result in violations of [Discord’s Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).  

---

## 4. Third-Party Services
- The Bot operates entirely within the Discord platform.  
- The Bot is subject to Discord’s [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).
